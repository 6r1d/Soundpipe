Soundpipe
=========

Soundpipe is a lightweight music DSP library written in C. It aims to provide
a set of high-quality DSP modules for composers, sound designers,
and creative coders.

Features
---------

- A great set of high-quality modules ported directly from the Csound library
- Sample accurate timing
- Small codebase
- Static library
- Easily extendable
- Easily embeddable


Compilation
-----------

By default, Soundpipe needs libsndfile, and a standard build environment. 
Other modules that use other external libraries will need to be explicitly compiled
by modififying config.mk.

If you are using a Mac, clone and build from the libsndfile repository here 
located here: https://github.com/erikd/libsndfile/

On Linux, the libsndfile-dev package will need to be installed.

To compile:

make

sudo make install


Building Examples and Tests
-----------

To build the examples, go into the examples folder and run "make", which will create
files with a .bin extention. To run an example, run "./ex_foo.bin
". When an example is run, it will generate a 
5 second file called "test.wav". Examples in the "extra"
folder are for optional modules that require third-party libraries. 
To compile these examples, uncomment the appropriate lines in "config.mk". If you run one of the "gen" examples, and want to see the plot results, you'll need to make sure you have gnuplot installed. 

Tests in Soundpipe are used to determine whether or not modules behave as expected. Tests write the output of a module to memory, and check the MD5 hash value of the output against the MD5 value of a reference signal. We're currently working to add tests for every Soundpipe module.  

To build a test file, go into the test folder, and run "make". Then, run "./run.bin", which runs the tests. As the tests are run, an "ok" will appear in the log if a test passes, and a "not ok" will appear if a test fails. 

If you would like to hear the audio output of the tests, run "make WRITE_RAW=1". This enables the output of the tests to be written to disk. Then, run "./run.bin", which runs the tests. Finally, run "sh write_wav.sh". This shell script produces a file called "out.wav", which is the audio output of every Soundpipe test. The shell script creates this file by concatenating the individual files (in a headerless raw format) to a wav file using SoX. 

The Soundpipe Model
-------------------

Soundpipe is callback driven. Every time Soundpipe needs a frame, it will
call upon a single function specified by the user. Soundpipe modules are
designed to process a signal one sample at a time.  Every module follows the
same life cycle:

1. Create: Memory is allocated for the data struct.
2. Initialize: Buffers are allocated, and initial variables and constants
are set.
3. Compute: the module takes in inputs (if applicable), and generates a
single sample of output.
4. Destroy: All memory allocated is freed.

Documentation
-------------
If you have lua installed on your computer, you can generate the current html
documentation for soundpipe by running "make docs". A folder called "docs"
will be created. The top page for the documentation is docs/index.html.
